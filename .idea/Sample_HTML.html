<h6>Track changes</h6>

Git will track the changes that you make in repository. Let us modify any file from the repository and compare it with the repository.

Navigate to VCS → Git → Compare with Latest Repository Version.

The above step will open the diff window.

You can see there is a new line on the right side with green background colour.

Git shows it in green as we have added new contents. If we remove any contents then it’ll be shown in red colour
